# Validation and convergence

These scripts are intended to build trust in the numerics (resolution sweeps, comparisons to known limits).

- `convergence_bn_over_B_toroidal_current.py`: convergence of max/RMS $|B_n|/|B|$ for a toroidal interior field generated by net poloidal current.

Run:

```bash
python examples/validation/convergence_bn_over_B_toroidal_current.py
```
